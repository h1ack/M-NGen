M-NGen Malware Revolution
I managed to develop a completely new type of malware... Honestly, I've never seen malware work this way before!

I was able to embed a hidden active process into any application! I tested it on applications like Discord, Telegram, and some others, and the method was completely successful... The challenge here is that antivirus software will perceive the application as a legitimate version of Discord or any other app! ðŸ˜³

The interesting part is that the embedding method I used is not the usual Process Injection technique.
